OMHUG operates under a set of values that drive everything we do, and each attendee should strive to embody and display these values whenever possible. There's one primary _Value 0_, and four pillar values that underlay and support that value.

## Value 0
In the immortal words of Wil Wheaton:

> Don't be a dick.

This should be reasonably self-explanatory, but to help clarify things we've called out four specific supporting values that we feel exemplify OMHUG.

## Pillar Values

### Unconditional Respect
Each OMHUG attendee should hold absolute respect for other attendees. Everyone who is at an OMHUG meeting is a human being and we should respect them accordingly. 

### Unconditional Compassion
Each OMHUG attendee should practice strenuous compassion for other attendees. Everyone who is at OMHUG has their own experiences with mental health or mental disorders and we should be compassionate towards their emotions.

### Confidentiality
As part of respect for other OMHUG attendees, we should follow the [confidentiality](http://omhug.github.io/confidentiality.md) guidelines and be judicious about what we say outside of the group.

### Mutual Support
Each OMHUG attendee is there to both support and be supported by other attendees. If we want to make sure that the others are there for us, we need to be there for them.
