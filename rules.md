title: Rules
---
OMHUG does not have very many rules. We believe that adherence to our [values](http://omhug.github.io/values.html) will solve almost any problem or question that comes up in the running of the group, so that's Rule 0:

## Rule 0
Follow the OMHUG values, especially Value 0.

## Guidelines
Beyond that we have a few guidelines that are intended to help our members to remove themselves from situations they find uncomfortable:

* If you feel uncomfortable enough at a table or during a meeting that you feel you need to leave, **please do so!** Don't feel bad about doing it! Protecting yourself is nothing to be ashamed of. 
* If someone leaves a table or meeting that you're at, you shouldn't feel bad either! The other person isn't judging you or what you're saying. You don't have to stop talking or change the topic.
* If you are being actively disruptive, you may be asked to leave for the remainder of the meeting so you can cool down. Come back for the next one.
