## Lean Coffee
OMHUG relies heavily on the [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) process to run our meetings. This allows everyone to have some control over what we talk about and what we do as a group. 

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things that we can do as part of the meeting:
* Lightning talks
* Discussion of newly-discovered resources
* Presentations from outside speakers
* Book discussion
* Group meditation
* Board games

## Meeting Format
The meetings will follow a format that's something like this:

1. Announcements.
1. Introductions of new members. You *do not* need to speak when you're introduced, but you can if you like.
1. Lean Coffee process, potentially splitting into smaller groups if we have a lot of attendees.
1. Coming together and restatement of purpose.
